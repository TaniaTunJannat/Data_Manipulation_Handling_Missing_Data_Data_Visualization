# **Data Science with Titanic Dataset & K-Means Clustering**  

## **Overview**  
This project involves data manipulation, missing data handling, data visualization, dataset merging, and K-Means clustering using Python and pandas. The project is divided into two parts:  

- **Project 1:** Titanic dataset analysis, missing value handling, feature engineering, and data visualization.  
- **Project 2:** Merging datasets, statistical analysis, and clustering student performance using K-Means.

## **Project 1: Titanic Dataset Analysis**  

### **Objectives**  
In this project, the following tasks were completed:  
✔️ Loaded the Titanic dataset from [GitHub link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PulockDas/pd-12-resources/refs/heads/master/titanic.csv)  
✔️ Identified and handled missing values in critical columns such as **'Age'** and **'Cabin'**  
✔️ Created a new feature, **'AgeClass'**, based on passenger age ranges  
✔️ Conducted data visualizations to analyze survival trends by gender, class, and age groups  

### **Visualizations**  
📊 **Bar charts:** Comparison of survival rates across **gender**, **Pclass**, and **AgeClass**  
📍 **Scatter plot (Age vs. Fare):** X-axis represents the passengers' age, Y-axis represents the fare paid, with 🟢 green for male survivors and 🔴 red for female survivors

## **Project 2: Student Performance Analysis & K-Means Clustering**  

### **Objectives**  
✔️ Merged multiple CSV files containing student test results  
✔️ Calculated best test marks, average marks, and final scores  
✔️ Applied **K-Means clustering** to categorize students based on their final scores  
✔️ Visualized clustering results using **Matplotlib**
